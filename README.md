# PRS-analysis-v01
We use Whole exome seq (WES), Imputed data and microarray data. The main goal of this project is to remove the sample overlap, redundancy, and relatedness from genetic data and merge them into single file. Below we discuss how our project work.
•	The provided code accomplishes a task related to merging and sorting data from variant call format (VCF) files in the context of genetic data analysis. The code contains two functions: `sort_tsv` is designed to sort the content of a VCF file based on a specific criterion, and `insert_data` is intended to insert data into a particular position within a tab-separated line. The main section of the code starts by defining input and output file paths, which are related to VCF files containing genetic data. Subsequently, the code reads and extracts sample IDs from two different VCF files, labeled as MA (microarray) and WES (whole exome sequencing).
•	The code then identifies common samples present in both MA and WES datasets. It iterates through the common sample IDs and, for each sample, opens the sorted WES and MA files. It proceeds to extract and compare genetic data from these files, determining the appropriate position to merge them while ensuring sorted order. The genetic data from both datasets is combined and written to an output VCF file, maintaining the required order. The code also employs a mechanism to handle cases where the position of data in one file surpasses that in the other.
Overall, the code facilitates the merging of genetic data from distinct datasets while considering their positions and maintaining a sorted output, thereby contributing to the analysis of genetic information from different sources. It's important to note that some portions of the code are commented out, indicating work in progress or optional functionality.

**Resources and Tools:**
We used the Python programming language to perform this task, leveraging its robust libraries and versatile syntax for efficient code implementation. Additionally, we chose the VSCode (Visual Studio Code) tool as our integrated development environment (IDE) due to its user-friendly interface, powerful features, and extensive support for Python development. This combination of Python and VSCode provided us with a seamless and productive environment to tackle the challenges of our project.
